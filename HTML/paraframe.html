    <h3>Paragraph Frame</h3>
    <p>
        Rapunzel is fascinated by the annual lights and, on her 18th birthday, asks to leave the tower and investigate them, but Gothel refuses, claiming the outside world is too dangerous. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace; he betrays the Stabbington brothers, his partners-in-crime, while being pursued by royal guard-horse Maximus. Flynn discovers and takes refuge in the tower, where Rapunzel knocks him out and hides him. When Gothel berates Rapunzel for mentioning the lanterns again and refuses to let her ever leave the tower, Rapunzel hatches a new plan and asks Gothel for new paint as a gift, sending her on a three-day journey. After hiding Flynn's satchel containing the crown, Rapunzel strikes a deal with Flynn, promising to return the crown in exchange for taking her to see the lanterns.
